# Food Delivery Data Analysis 🍔📊

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook created as part of a food delivery data analysis hackathon.  
The goal of this project is to combine data from multiple sources and extract meaningful insights using Python.

## Task Description
The analysis involves:
- Loading order data from a CSV file
- Loading user data from a JSON file
- Loading restaurant data from an SQL database
- Merging all datasets into a single final dataset
- Performing exploratory analysis to understand user behavior, revenue trends, and performance metrics

The merged dataset is treated as the **single source of truth** for all insights.

## Key Analysis Areas
- Order trends over time  
- User behavior and membership impact (Gold vs Regular)  
- City-wise and cuisine-wise performance  
- Revenue distribution and seasonality  

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- SQLite  

## Files
- `food_delivery_analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing data loading, merging, and analysis

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates practical data handling, integration, and analytical thinking using real-world food delivery datasets.
